## Abstract

Warning: This paper contains potentially harmful text.

Jailbreaks on large language models (LLMs) have recently received increasing attention. For a comprehensive assessment of LLM safety, it is essential to consider jailbreaks with diverse attributes, such as contextual coherence and sentiment/stylistic variations, and hence it is beneficial to study controllable jailbreaking, i.e. how to enforce control on LLM attacks. In this paper, we formally formulate the controllable attack generation problem, and build a novel connection between this problem and controllable text generation, a well-explored topic of natural language processing. Based on this connection, we adapt the Energy-based Constrained Decoding with Langevin Dynamics (COLD), a state-of-the-art, highly efficient algorithm in controllable text generation, and introduce the COLD-Attack framework which unifies and automates the search of adversarial LLM attacks under a variety of control requirements such as fluency, stealthiness, sentiment, and left-right-coherence. The controllability enabled by COLD-Attack leads to diverse new jailbreak scenarios which not only cover the standard setting of generating fluent (suffix) attack with continuation constraint, but also allow us to address new controllable attack settings such as revising a user query adversarially with paraphrasing constraint, and inserting stealthy attacks in context with position constraint. Our extensive experiments on various LLMs (Llama-2, Mistral, Vicuna, Guanaco, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4) show COLD-Attack's broad applicability, strong controllability, high success rate, and attack transferability. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yu-Fangxu/COLD-Attack.

## 1. Introduction

Recently, jailbreaking on large language models (LLMs) has received increasing attention from the machine learning community (Goldstein et al., 2023; Kang et al., 2023). Identifying various jailbreaks is crucial for fixing potential vulnerabilities in LLMs, marking itself an important research topic for AI safety. Currently, jailbreaking techniques can be categorized as white-box approaches (Guo et al., 2021; Wen et al., 2023; Wallace et al., 2019; Zou et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023d) and black-box methods (Shen et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2023a; Abdelnabi et al., 2023; Perez &amp; Ribeiro, 2022; Li et al., 2023b; Zeng et al., 2024; Mehrotra et al., 2023; Chao et al., 2023). Both strategies are crucial and provide complementary benefits in deepening our understanding of LLM safety. Specifically, white-box methods require the use of internal model knowledge but are capable of generating less predictable attacks in an automated manner. In comparison, black-box methods can directly probe commercial LLMs with no internal access, while they typically rely on more patterned prompts. To provide a comprehensive safety evaluation of LLMs, both white-box and black-box methods should be further studied.

In this paper, we tackle a critical unresolved challenge in automatic white-box methods: the controllability of adversarial LLM attacks. Originally, state-of-the-art white-box techniques such as GCG (Zou et al., 2023) fail to produce semantically meaningful attacks and are highly susceptible to perplexity-based defense. Recent advancements, particularly through two AutoDAN publications (Zhu et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023d), have focused on generating fluent attacks automatically to bypass perplexity filters for the purpose of improving stealthiness. However, fluency alone does not guarantee stealthiness in general. More importantly, a thorough safety assessment of LLMs demands rigorous adversarial testing across diverse attack features beyond fluency. Currently, the path to constraining automatic whitebox methods to impose controlled features (e.g., sentiments, contextual coherence, etc) on generated attacks remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we develop the first automatic search framework that gives a unified treatment of controllability and stealthiness in white-box LLM attacks.

Our contributions are threefold. First, we formulate the controllable attack generation problem and connect this problem to controllable text generation, a well-explored subfield of natural language processing (NLP). Such a perspective bridges two extensively researched domains, offering the potential for automated jailbreaking with enhanced stealthiness and controllability. Second, built upon this connection, we tailor the Energy-based Constrained Decoding with Langevin Dynamics (COLD), a state-of-the-art controllable text generation algorithm developed from (Qin et al., 2022), to develop the COLD-Attack framework which unifies and automates the search of adversarial LLM attacks under a variety of control requirements such as fluency, stealthiness, sentiment, and left-right-coherence. Diverging from the discrete token-level optimization in GCG, COLD-Attack leverages Langevin dynamics (Welling &amp; Teh, 2011) to perform efficient gradient-based sampling in the continuous logit space, and relies on a guided decoding process to translate the continuous logit sequences into discrete texts. COLDAttack can be viewed as an energy-based method where one can impose various controls on the sampling of LLM attacks via using properly-designed energy functions. For example, one can use COLD-Attack to paraphrase a given question into an attack (even under sentiment constraints), or insert an attack into two sentences with left-right-coherence being maintained. Finally, we demonstrate various advantages of COLD-Attack through a comprehensive evaluation study across various old and new settings. Table 1 summarizes a high-level comparison of the existing white-box attack methods and COLD-Attack.

In our numerical study, we observe: i) COLD-Attack can efficiently 1 generate fluent (suffix) attacks with the continuation constraint and outperform existing methods such as AutoDAN-Zhu in such an existing setting, ii) via novel use of energy functions, COLD-Attack is capable of generating paraphrase attacks 2 with or without sentiment control, and iii) COLD-Attack can generate diverse adversarial prompts satisfying the position constraint under various sentiment/lexical/format/style requirements (on outputs). In all the settings, the attacks generated from our method not only

1 COLD-Attack can be much faster than GCG-type methods due to the removal of the greedy search step. See Table 4.

2 We refer this setting as attack with paraphrasing constraint.

exhibit fluency but also adhere to the pre-defined user requirements, supporting our claim that COLD-Attack offers a more versatile and controllable attack strategy. As a preview, Figure 1 provides a few selected samples obtained from our energy-based method to showcase the power of COLD-Attack in all three settings (more examples can be found in Appendix D). We view COLD-Attack as a complement rather than a replacement of existing methods (e.g. GCG, AutoDAN, etc). We hope that our perspective on controllable attacks can inspire more works along this direction.

## 2. Related Work

Black-box vs. White-box Attacks Black-box attacks typically draw inspiration from manually crafted jailbreak prompts (WitchBOT, 2023; DAN, 2023) to create sophisticated malicious queries (Wei et al., 2023a; Abdelnabi et al., 2023; Perez &amp; Ribeiro, 2022; Liu et al., 2023d; Li et al., 2023b; Zeng et al., 2024). Interestingly, (Wei et al., 2023a) proposes failure modes such as competing objectives and mismatched generalization to guide the design of jailbreak attacks. In addition, (Shah et al., 2023; Zeng et al., 2024) unitize LLMs to craft jailbreak prompts using persona modulation and persuasion techniques to steer the target models to produce harmful responses. Since black-box attacks rely on patterned templates, white-box automatic search (Zou et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2021; Wen et al., 2023; Wallace et al., 2019; Jones et al., 2023) is needed for diversifying attacks. The most well-known automatic search method is GCG (Zou et al., 2023), which uses tokenlevel optimization to append an adversarial suffix. However, GCG yields gibberish suffixes that are easily detectable by simple perplexity-based defense (Jain et al., 2023). To remedy this, AutoDAN-Zhu (Zhu et al., 2023) extends GCG via a double-loop optimization method to produce fluent jailbreak prompts. However, it utilizes an auto-regressive token-by-token generation approach, inherently limiting its capability in imposing control on attacks. AutoDAN-Liu (Liu et al., 2023d) connects white-box and black-box methods via a novel combination of automatic genetic search and manually crafted jailbreak prompts. It is unclear how to enforce control on attacks generated by AutoDAN-Liu.

Controllable Text Generation Here we also briefly review controllable text generation. To address lexical constraints, Neurologic (Lu et al., 2020; 2021) integrates a

keyword score into beam search to steer text generation, while DeLorean (Qin et al., 2020) uses gradients from future tokens to guide sentence formation. PPLM (Dathathri et al., 2019) and Fudge (Yang &amp; Klein, 2021) utilize an auxiliary discriminator to direct token generation towards. Recent advancements include RL-based methods (Lu et al., 2022; Mudgal et al., 2023) and guided sampling processes (Liu et al., 2023c; Forristal et al., 2023; Mireshghallah et al., 2022). Noticeably, COLD (Qin et al., 2022) provides a state-of-the-art method via adopting energy models.

impose control on various text features such as semantics, style, keywords, and position. Inspired by this, we define controllable attack generation as the problem of finding a sequence y that simultaneously attacks the target LLM successfully and satisfies a collection of extra constraints. For this problem, the control is directly posed on the attack y , and hence y is termed as a "controllable attack." Later, we will explain how to pose various constraints on y to improve stealthiness and diversify attack features.

## 3. Controllability and Stealthiness for Attacks

In this section, we formulate the controllable attack generation problem, discuss the relevance to stealthy LLM attacks, and connect this problem to controllable text generation.

Notation Each LLM uses a tokenizer T to convert text into tokens from its vocabulary V . Let x represent a single token. Let x = ( x 1 , x 2 , /uni22EF , x n ) denote a token sequence. An LLM can be viewed as a mapping from x to the probability distribution of the next token, p LM (⋅∣ x ) . The probability of the next token being x is denoted as p LM ( x ∣ x ) , and we use p LM ( y ∣ x ) to denote the probability of the next token sequence y given the preceding token sequence x . The sub-sequence of y up to the ( i -1 ) -th token is denoted as y &lt; i ∶= ( y 1 , /uni22EF , y i -1 ) . We use ⊕ for concatenating token sequences. Hence adding a continuation y to a sequence x can be denoted as x ⊕ y . In addition, we denote a sequence of logit vectors as ˜ y = ( ˜ y 1 , ˜ y 2 , /uni22EF , ˜ y n ) , with ˜ y i ∈ R ∣V∣ and each ˜ y i ( v ) ∈ R being the logit of a token v in the vocabulary.

## 3.1. General Problem: Controllable Attack Generation

Recall that controllable text generation can be viewed as the problem of finding a sequence that satisfies a collection of constraints. The diverse choices of constraints allow us to

Here we give a mathematical formulation. Suppose there are m constraints in total. For i = 1 , /uni22EF , m , let c i ( y ) be an indicator function such that c i ( y ) = 1 if the sequence y satisfies the i -th constraint and c i ( y ) = 0 otherwise. These constraints could enforce aspects like fluency, attack success, sentiment, position, style, keywords, etc. Then the controllable attack generation problem is defined as

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where c 1 (⋅) is the indicator function for y being a successful attack, and c 2 (⋅) is the indicator function for the attack being fluent. For 3 ≤ i ≤ m , extra constraint c i can be chosen to enforce more control on attack y , leading to diverse features.

## 3.2. Relevance to Stealthy LLM Attacks

For (1), the flexible choices of c i (⋅) will allow us to generate attacks with diverse features. Now we discuss how to set up c i to make the jailbreak attacks stealthy in various ways. For the ease of exposition, denote the malicious user query as x . For illustrations, consider the following three scenarios.

Attack with Continuation Constraint This setting has recently been considered in (Zhu et al., 2023). The goal is to generate a continuation y and append it to the user query x , such that x ⊕ y is fluent and can lead the LLM to produce harmful contents z . The fluency of x ⊕ y can cause

Figure 2. Illustration of attacks with paraphrasing constraint and with position constraint. Upper: paraphrase attack rephrases the original harmful query with or without sentiment steering (negative sentiment steering in the above example); Lower: attack with position constraint creates a bridging attack prompt with a separate prompt p to control the LLM outputs (style control in the above example).

difficulty for perplexity filtering, making the attack more stealthy than GCG. The (suffix) attack with continuation constraint can be formulated as (1), if we choose c 1 (⋅) as the indicator function for x ⊕ y triggering harmful content and c 2 (⋅) as the indicator function for x ⊕ y being fluent.

Attack with Paraphrasing Constraint To hide the attack position for enhanced stealthiness, one idea is to rephrase the user query x into a new sentence y while retaining its semantic meaning and achieving successful attacks at the same time. Then, one cannot just defend the attack by removing the continuation (or suffix). The attack with paraphrasing constraint can be formulated as (1), if we set c 1 (⋅) as the indicator function for y triggering harmful content, c 2 (⋅) as the indicator function for y being fluent, and an additional paraphrasing constraint c 3 (⋅) as the indicator function for y being semantically similar to the original query x . To control the sentiment of y , we can add a fourth constraint c 4 (⋅) as the indicator function for y yielding a given sentiment. See Figure 2 for illustrations.

Attack with Position Constraint Another way to improve stealthiness is to insert the attack between two sentences in an unnoticeable way such that one cannot just defend the attack via removing the suffix continuation. For example, suppose in addition to the user query x , a separate prompt p is used to enforce some extra sentimental/lexical/format/style constraints on the LLM output z . Wecan "hide" the attack y between x and p to induce stealthiness. The goal is to generate a sequence y such that the concatenated text x ⊕ y ⊕ p is fluent and leads to the required harmful responses at the same time. Requiring x ⊕ y ⊕ p being fluent enforces y to satisfy the position constraint (this is different from previous study (Zhu et al., 2023) that only requires x ⊕ y to be fluent). Such an attack problem can be formulated as (1), if we set up c 1 (⋅) as the indicator function for x ⊕ y ⊕ p triggering harmful responses, and c 2 (⋅) as the indicator function for y satisfying the position constraint. Figure 2 also illustrates this scenario.

Therefore, we can add fluency/semantic/sentiment/position constraints on the attack y to induce stealthiness (or other features). Except for the attack with (suffix) continuation constraint, the other two settings considered above are new. Our formulation poses control on the attack y directly. This is different from the existing perspective that views LLM attacks as "controlling the LLM output to be unsafe" (Jones et al., 2023). We hope that our insights can inspire more studies on new choices of c i (⋅) to further diversify attack settings/features.

## 3.3. Connections with Controllable Text Generation

We have discussed the generality of the controllable attack generation problem (1). It will be really beneficial if we can come up with general methods for solving (1). Here, we make the key observation that the only difference between (1) and the other problems studied in controllable text generation is due to the use of the first constraint c 1 (⋅) that enforces y to be a successful attack. If we remove the first constraint c 1 ( y ) = 1 , then (1) is just the controllable text generation problem, which has been extensively studied in NLP. Based on this intriguing observation, the algorithms in controllable text generation are directly applicable to the controllable attack generation problem (1), as long as we can modify those algorithms to include the successful attack constraint c 1 ( y ) = 1 . From (Zou et al., 2023), one can induce the successful attack constraint c 1 ( y ) = 1 via maximizing the probability of generating certain responses (such as affirmative answers) conditioned on y . Such a perspective can be used to provide a general routine for modifying existing controllable text generation algorithms to further include the successful attack constraint c 1 ( y ) = 1 while maintaining other constraints. Next, we will concretize this idea, and tailor COLD, a state-of-the-art controllable text generation method, to develop a principled approach for solving the controllable attack generation problem (1).

## 4. COLD-Attack

This section introduces our attack method: COLD-Attack, which adapts COLD (Qin et al., 2022), a state-of-the-art controllable text generation method, for solving the controllable attack generation problem (1) in an automated manner. Our key insight is that COLD is an energy-based method, and hence the adversarial cost function used in GCG can be integrated into COLD as an extra energy function inducing

Figure 3. An illustration of COLD-Attack. A compositional energy function E ( ˜ y ) is constructed based on the attack constraints. The Langevin sampling begins with an initial logits sequence ˜ y 0 , and the final iteration ˜ y N approximates a sample from the target distribution. Following a decoding process (Section B.2), the resulting adversarial prompt x ⊕ y successfully jailbreaks the target LLMs.

attack successes. As illustrated in Figure 3, our COLDAttack framework includes three main steps: (i) Energy function formulation : specify energy functions properly to capture the attack constraints in (1), (ii) Langevin dynamics sampling : run Langevin dynamics recursively for N steps to obtain a good energy-based model governing the adversarial attack logits ˜ y N , (iii) Decoding process : leverage an LLM-guided decoding process to covert the continuous logit ˜ y N into discrete text attacks y . Next we provide more explanations for each step of the algorithm.

In the first step, we represent the control requirements on the adversarial attack as a class of energy functions { E i ( ˜ y )} , where lower values of E i ( ˜ y ) indicate that ˜ y better satisfies the corresponding requirement. We will discuss how to set up E i ( ˜ y ) for various controllable attack settings later. Once { E i ( ˜ y )} is specified, we define the associated compositional energy function as E ( ˜ y ) ∶= ∑ i λ i E i ( ˜ y ) , where λ i ≥ 0 is the weight to be tuned. In the second step, we use the gradient information ∇ ˜ y E ( ˜ y ) , and run Langevin dynamics over the continuous logit space as follows

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where η n &gt; 0 is the step size, and ϵ n ∼ N( 0 , σ n I ) is the noise at step n . The process is initialized with a large noise scale that achieves large-scale exploration in space and provides a larger possibility for samples to jump out of local optimums. With the right amount of noise and proper step size, Langevin dynamics (2) can approach the optimal distribution (Welling &amp; Teh, 2011). Finally, after running Langevin dynamics for N steps, we obtain continuous logits sequence ˜ y N which is then decoded into a fluent discrete text attack y . The decoding method is subtle and borrowed from COLD (Qin et al., 2022). Without the novel decoding method from COLD, the resultant y is typically not fluent. The decoding method is reviewed in Appendix B.2. A pseudo-code for

COLD-Attack is given in Algorithm 1.

Remark 4.1 . Our attack framework is flexible, allowing the integration of any valid energy functions based on control requirements. In addition, COLD-Attack only samples the discrete text attack once in the end. This is different than GCG (Zou et al., 2023) which relies on greedy search to perform discrete token-level optimization at every step. COLD-Attack also differs from AutoDAN-Zhu (Zhu et al., 2023), which generates fluent attacks in an autoregressive manner. The non-autoregressive nature of COLD-Attack enables incorporating complex constraints such as paraphrasing constraint.

## 4.1. Energy Functions for Controllable Attacks

The key for COLD-Attack is the specification of energy functions. Now we introduce the energy functions that can be used to capture various constraints in controllable attack generation. More discussion can be found in Appendix B.

Attack success: We can use the adversarial cost in (Zou et al., 2023) to design an energy function that forces the target LLM to respond start with a positive affirmation of the malicious request x . We have E att ( y ; z ) ∶= -log p LM ( z ∣ y ) , where y is the adversarial prompt and z is the desired LLM

N

output (e.g. "Sure, here is [malicious user request].").

Fluency: To induce fluency, we use the following energy function that constrains logit sequences ˜ y exhibiting autoregressive dependency according to the underlying LLMs:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Intrinsically, the above energy function encourages the distribution of softmax ( ˜ y i ( v )) across the vocabulary to closely match the predictions of an underlying LLM.

Semantic similarity: For paraphrase attack, we require the attack y and the original user query x to have similar semantic meaning. We can use a sequence-level similarity energy function defined as E sim ( y ) ∶= -cos ( emb ( y ) , emb ( x )) , where emb (⋅) computes the average embedding vector of all tokens in a sequence.

Lexical constraint: A lexical energy function can be used to control the presence of certain words/phrases. For controlling sentiment, we can ensure the inclusion of particular keywords in y . To achieve this, we capture such lexical constraints using an n-gram similarity energy function:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where k list represents the list of keywords or phrases whose occurrence in y needs to be controlled. The function ngram \_ match is a differential n-gram matching function (Liu et al., 2021b), serving as an approximation of BLEU-n metric (Papineni et al., 2002). Similarly, to induce successful attacks, we can further suppress specific refusal phrases from appearing in y and construct an n-gram-based energy function E lex using the same technique.

## 4.2. Final Energy-based Models for Attacks

The energy functions introduced above are powerful enough to address various control requirements in (1). We illustrate this on the three settings in Section 3.2.

Attack with Continuation Constraint In this setting, the user query x is given. We need to find the adversarial continuation y to guarantee the fluency of x ⊕ y and the success of the attack. Let z be the desired LLM output (e.g. "Sure, here is [malicious user request]."). We can set the compositional energy function as

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where λ 1 E att ( x ⊕ y ; z ) + λ 3 E lex ( y ) captures the first constraint in (1) to make the attack successful, and λ 2 E flu ( x ⊕ y ) addresses the 2nd constraint on the fluency of x ⊕ y .

Attack with Paraphrasing Constraint In this setting, we want to rephrase the user query x as an attack y and ensure both the fluency of y and the attack success. We can specify the compositional energy function E ( y ) =

λ 1 E att ( y ; z ) + λ 2 E flu ( y ) + λ 3 E sim ( y , x ) , where the first term λ 1 E att ( y ; z ) captures the first constraint in (1) on making the attack successful, the 2nd term λ 2 E flu ( y ) addresses the second constraint in (1) on the fluency of y , and the 3rd term captures the last paraphrasing constraint in (1) on enforcing y to be semantically similar to the original user query x . To add sentiment control, we can use λ 4 E lex ( y , k list ) where k list consists of sentiment keywords.

Attack with Position Constraint In this setting, we want to search and insert an attack y between the user query x and the extra prompt p to ensure the success of the attack and position constraint. We can set the energy function as

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where λ 1 E att ( x ⊕ y ⊕ p ; z ) + λ 3 E lex ( y ) captures the first constraint in (1) on making the attack successful, and the term λ 2 E flu ( x ⊕ y ⊕ p ) addresses the second constraint in (1) on maintaining fluency and coherence of the whole sentence.

## 5. Experimental Evaluations

In this section, we evaluate COLD-Attack on various LLMs under three aforementioned attack settings and present the main results. More details/results are given in Appendix D.

Language models. We use several white-box LLMs, including Vicuna-7B-v1.5 (Vicuna) (Chiang et al., 2023), Llama-2-7B-Chat-hf (Llama2) (Touvron et al., 2023), Guanaco-7B-HF (Guanaco) (Dettmers et al., 2023), and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 (Mistral) (Jiang et al., 2023). We note that Llama-2-7B-Chat-hf has undergone explicit safety alignment. Hugging Face repository links for these models can be found in Table 9. Later, we will use GPT-3.5 turbo and GPT-4 to study the transferability of COLD-Attack. In addition, we evaluate the performance of COLD-Attack with three 13B LLMs, as detailed in Appendix D.3. The models tested include Vicuna-13B-v1.5, Guanaco-13B-HF, and Llama2-13B-Chat-hf.

Datasets. For efficient evaluation, we use a subset of AdvBench introduced in (Zou et al., 2023) to assess COLDAttack. This dataset comprises 50 instructions designed to solicit harmful content. These instructions are selected from the original dataset to cover a wide range of harmful topics while minimizing duplicates.

Evaluation metrics. Following (Huang et al., 2023), we use a substring-matching based Attack Success Rate ( ASR ) to quantitatively evaluate the performance of COLD-Attack. ASR measures the percentage of instructions that elicit corresponding harmful outputs. Additionally, we employ a GPT-4-based ASR ( ASR-G ) to assess whether a response

For completeness, our table also includes AutoDAN-Liu*, which partially relies on manually crafted prompts. COLD-Attack do not need manually crafted prompts. Hence AutoDAN-Liu is not treated as a baseline.

accurately fulfills the malicious instruction. This metric has shown a higher correlation with human annotations.

To evaluate the fluency of the generated prompts, we use perplexity ( PPL ), calculated with Vicuna-7b. We also introduce Succ , which represents the percentage of samples that successfully adhere to the proposed constraints. Furthermore, a range of NLP-related evaluation metrics, including BERTScore, BLEU, and ROUGE, are applied to assess the quality of the generated controllable attacks.

once the outputs of the LLMs do not contain any predefined rejection phrases. Typically, GCG and GCG-reg tend to terminate on these three LLMs before reaching the full 500 steps, resulting in 100% ASR.

Baselines. We compare COLD-Attack with a range of white-box attack methods as baselines, including UAT (Wallace et al., 2019), GBDA (Guo et al., 2021), PEZ (Wen et al., 2023), GCG (Zou et al., 2023), and AutoDAN-Zhu (Zhu et al., 2023). Furthermore, we include GCG-reg, a perplexity-regularized version of GCG. See Appendix C.2 for a detailed description of baseline setups.

## 5.1. Results: Attack with Continuation Constraint

Table 2 reports the ASR, ASR-G, and PPL for both our method and the baseline methods, as well as the Promptonly baseline where we only use the malicious query as input feeding to the LLMs. Based on the results, we have the following key observations:

(i) COLD-Attack achieves best or second best ASRs across all LLMs. GCG, GCG-reg, AutoDAN-Zhu, and COLD-Attack all demonstrate high ASR and ASR-G compared to other baseline methods (PEZ, GBDA, and UAT). Notably, COLD-Attack achieves the best or second-best ASRs across all LLMs and excels in ASR-G, achieving the highest ASR-G on Guanaco and Mistral, and ranking second on Vicuna and Llama2 with comparable success rates. On the other hand, both GCG and GCG-reg achieve 100% ASR on Vicuna, Guanaco, and Mistral. This high success rate is attributed to an early termination mechanism used in these methods, which stops the optimization process

(ii) COLD-Attack generates the most fluent adversarial prompts with lowest PPL. Both AutoDAN-Zhu and COLD-Attack stand out by achieving better stealthiness with lower PPL compared to other methods. Specifically, COLD-Attack excels further by outperforming AutoDANZhu across all evaluated LLMs. For a comprehensive evaluation, we also report the results of AutoDAN-Liu (Liu et al., 2023d) on Vicuna, Guanaco, and Llama2. Nevertheless, it is important to note that AutoDAN-Liu partially relies on manually crafted prompts (it combines automatic genetic search with manually crafted prompts), resulting in the lowest PPL for Vicuna and Guanaco. Despite this, COLD-Attack achieves a lower PPL on Llama2. Since COLD-Attack does not need manually crafted prompts at all and can potentially generate more diverse attacks, a direct comparison with AutoDAN-Liu may not be that meaningful. The right interpretation for our experimental results is that COLD-Attack and AutoDAN-Liu provide complementary benefits.

(iii) COLD-Attack can generate diverse adversarial prompts. To quantitatively assessing the diversity of generated prompts, we adopt the following standard metrics: Distinct N-grams Score (DNS) (Li et al., 2015), Averaged distinct N-grams (ADN) (Tevet &amp; Berant, 2020), and Self-BLEU (Zhu et al., 2018), and compare COLD-Attack with AutoDAN-Zhu, and AutoDAN-Liu across four studied LLMs. From Table 3, it is evident that COLD-Attack consistently outperforms the baseline methods in generating more diverse adversarial prompts.

(iv) COLD-Attack is more efficient compared to GCG and AutoDAN-Zhu. Regarding computation efficiency, unlike GCG, our approach does not require extensive batch

loss calculations at each step, leading to a significantly more efficient optimization process. In particular, COLD-Attack is on average 10 × faster than GCG and GCG-reg: executing COLD-Attack for a single request using a single NVIDIA V100 GPU takes about 20 minutes (with 2000 steps and a batch of 8 samples), while GCG and GCG-reg require approximately 3.23 hours for the same task (with 500 steps and a batch size of 512). We report the detailed running time in Table 4 in the appendix.

For completeness, the full results of COLD-Attack on all the 520 samples in AdvBench are provided in Table 20 in the appendix. In addition, we present the results of transferability experiments in Appendix D.1. Finally, we present the comparison of the COLD-Attack and black-box attack methods, and the effectiveness of COLD-Attack under a wide range of defense methods in Appendix D.

## 5.2. Results: Attack with Paraphrasing Constraint

In this section, we present the experimental results of COLDAttack with paraphrasing constraint. Specifically, we make the following key observations:

(i) COLD-Attack achieves the best ASRs compared to three other baseline methods. We compare COLD-Attack with three other baseline methods: PRISM (Thompson &amp;

Post, 2020a;b), PAWS (Zhang et al., 2019), and GPT-4 based paraphrasing. As shown in Table 5, our COLD-Attack approach not only produces high-quality rephrasing 3 but also significantly outperforms three other baseline methods in terms of ASR. For comparison, the rephrase generated by GPT-4 yields BLEU and ROUGE scores of 0.37 and 0.38, respectively, indicating a reduced lexical similarity to the original requests compared to COLD-Attack. Moreover, GPT-4 rephrase achieves a BERTScore of 0.75. This is similar to COLD-Attack in terms of semantic similarity.

(ii) COLD-Attack is capable of incorporating sentiment steering. We further integrate the lexical constraint energy function, which encourages the inclusion of specific words that convey positive (e.g., "joyful") or negative (e.g., "anxious") sentiments within the generated prompts. As shown in Table 7, COLD-Attack effectively controls the sentiment of the adversarial prompts, as demonstrated by the high Succ and ASRs. Interestingly, our experiments reveal that different LLMs exhibit varying susceptibilities to different sentiments. Particularly, attacks leveraging negative sentiment attain higher ASRs on Mistral and Guanaco, with ASR-G augmenting by 30% and 14% respectively. Conversely, Llama2 shows greater vulnerability to positive sentiment attacks, where its ASR-G saw an 18% increase when shifting from negative to positive sentiment attacks. This shows that emotional stimuli influence on LLM safety is model-dependent, and the controllability of attacks is essential for holistically evaluating LLM safety.

## 5.3. Results: Attack with Position Constraint

In this section, we present the results of COLD-Attack with position constraint. In particular, we utilize COLD-Attack to craft bridge adversarial prompts that seamlessly connect

3 For example, the closer the BERTScore is to 1 , the more similar the attack is with respect to the original user query. The BERTScore for COLD-Attack is above 0 . 7 on all LLMs, nearly matching the BERTScore of 0.75 by GPT-4 rephrase, demonstrating the good quality of rephrasing.

Table 6. Experimental results for attack with position constraint under four types of output constraints. Prompt-only serves as a baseline where we concatenate the user query and control prompt directly and feed them to Llama2. The best result for each metric is highlighted in bold.

the original malicious queries and a separate prompt constraining the outputs of LLMs. We set up separate prompts to manipulate the outputs of LLMs to adhere to four distinct types of constraints: 1. Sentimental control aims to manipulate the sentiment of the LLMs' responses. 2. Lexical control ensures the inclusion of specified words within the output of LLMs. 3. Format control dictates the structure of the LLMs' response, requiring outputs in particular formats such as JSON or Markdown. 4. Style control directs the responses of LLMs to mimic the style of specific platforms, such as Twitter or Instagram. See Table 10 for the detailed prompts utilized for each control type. We use PPL to measure the fluency of the generated adversarial prompts. For the sentimental control, generated outputs are also evaluated using an external discriminator (Loureiro et al., 2022). The success rates under format control and style control are determined through human annotations. For baseline comparisons, we concatenate the malicious queries with the control prompt before submitting them to the target LLM (Llama2). We make the following observations:

(i) COLD-Attack is able to fulfill position constraints while maintaining effective attacks. The results in Table 6 illustrate that COLD-Attack not only effectively generates stealthy attacks that satisfy the position requirement but also allows the use of separate prompts to pose output constraints on the target LLMs. Specifically, both the ASR and ASRG exceed 80%, with the highest PPL equal to 99.03 for Guanaco under lexical constraint. Moreover, the success rates (Succ) remain above 68% for all types of constraints and across all tested LLMs.

ble 8 compared the performance of COLD-Attack to baseline approaches on Llama2 with position constraint. It can be seen that both COLD-Attack and AutoDAN-Zhu attain higher ASRs and significantly lower PPL values than GCG. Notably, COLD-Attack consistently records the lowest PPL across all constraint scenarios, averaging 2 × lower than AutoDAN-Zhu and approximately 40 × less than GCG. This demonstrates the importance of posing control on the position of the adversarial prompts explicitly.

Summary. We can conclude that COLD-Attack works well under all three scenarios and generates stealthy/controllable attacks. Our study in this section follows the attack setting in (Huang et al., 2023), where the system prompt is omitted. More discussions on the impact of system prompts can be found in Appendix D.8.

## 6. Conclusion

In this work, we introduce COLD-Attack for the automatic generation of stealthy and controllable adversarial prompts. Our study establishes the strong capability of COLD-Attack to embed a variety of controlled features within attacks. Comprehensive evaluations across three distinct attack settings indicate the versatility and effectiveness of COLDAttack. We hope our unified perspective on connecting LLM jailbreaking and controllable text generation will inspire more research on diversifying LLM attacks.

## Impact Statement

This study presents COLD-Attack, a method for generating controllable adversarial prompts targeting LLMs. Despite the rising interest in jailbreaking LLMs, the direct harm of COLD-Attack is limited. Our research aims to deepen the understanding of LLM robustness and enhance their safety, promoting safer AI environments. However, we acknowledge the potential negative societal impact of our work and the presence of potentially offensive and harmful text in our paper. In particular, COLD-Attack could be misused for harmful purposes, such as spreading misinformation, bypassing content moderation, or generating biased or harmful outputs. The method generates fluent, stealthy, and contextually coherent adversarial prompts, posing new challenges for LLM defense. Addressing these risks is essential for ethical deployment. We recognize the potential harm caused by the generated adversarial prompts and the ethical implications of our attack framework.

To prevent misuse, various safeguards (e.g., Llama Guard) can be employed against unethical applications. Additionally, COLD-Attack can be used to improve LLM safety by generating diverse attacks for finetuning and safeguard design. We encourage future research to focus on: i) detecting stealthy adversarial prompts, ii) incorporating adversarial training into LLM finetuning, iii) developing collaborative defense strategies with shared resources, and iv) ensuring ethical research that protects user privacy and avoids introducing biases. We also strongly encourage future research to prioritize the development of effective defenses against adversarial prompts, with the goal of improving the overall safety and trustworthiness of LLMs. By focusing on these critical areas, we can work towards creating a safer and more secure AI environment while mitigating the potential negative impacts of our research.

## A. Additional Related Work

## A.1. Safety Aligned LLMs

Safety-aligned LLMs are trained to match human values to ensure that their behavior aligns with desired ethical standards (Korbak et al., 2023). Various methods have been developed to enhance this alignment. For instance, data filtering is employed to remove harmful, confidential, or prejudiced content from the training dataset to prevent the propagation of such content in the LLM's outputs (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023). Supervised safety fine-tuning (Chung et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023) teaches LLMs to align with safety-oriented guidelines to further ensure their responses adhere to predefined safety protocols. Furthermore, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) fine-tunes LLMs using a reward model trained on human preferences, which adjusts pre-trained models to better reflect human values, steering clear of generating harmful content by leveraging rewards that emphasize helpfulness and harmlessness (Christiano et al., 2017; Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022; Leike et al., 2018; Glaese et al., 2022). RLHF, in particular, plays a pivotal role in refining the output of LLMs, ensuring their utility while mitigating risks associated with generating undesirable content.

## A.2. Jailbreak LLMs

Beyond the mentioned approaches in Section 2, a variety of techniques have been developed to jailbreak Large Language Models (LLMs) from different perspectives: AutoPrompt (Shin et al., 2020) uses a two-step optimization method to automatically create LLM prompts for a diverse set of tasks. Persona modulation (Shah et al., 2023) facilitates personality for LLMs to make them more likely to comply with harmful instructions. (Zhao et al., 2024) explores the manipulation of LLM output logits to increase the likelihood of generating harmful content. GBRT (Wichers et al., 2024) utilizes the gradient information for automatically generating diverse prompts that are likely to cause an language model to output unsafe responses, where the prompts are updated by scoring an LM response with a safety classifier and then backpropagating through the frozen safety classifier and language model. Furthermore, (Yang et al., 2023) employ fine-tuning LLMs with a small amount of malicious content to subtly undermine LLM safety mechanisms. (Rando &amp; Tramèr, 2023) contaminate the RLHF training dataset to undermine the safety of LLMs. In addition, other forms of jailbreak such as multimodal jailbreak (Gong et al., 2023; Tu et al., 2023; Qi et al., 2023; Carlini et al., 2023), in-context attacks (Wei et al., 2023b; Kandpal et al., 2023; Qiang et al., 2023). (shu et al., 2024; Yip et al., 2024) investigate the susceptibility of LLMs to various attack vectors. MJP (Li et al., 2023a) crafts multi-step prompts to extract privacy information from ChatGPT. (Liu et al., 2023e; Zhang &amp; Ippolito, 2023) employ jailbreak attacks to extract system prompts of LLMs, RADIAL (Du et al., 2023) examines the rejection tendencies of LLMs, aiming to amplify their potential for generating harmful responses. Additionally, (Perez &amp; Ribeiro, 2022; Deng et al., 2022; Anonymous, 2024) use reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to discover prompts that lead models to generate harmful responses. (Lapid et al., 2023) generates attacks built upon genetic algorithm. MASTERKEY (Deng et al., 2023) automatically generates jailbreak prompts for fine-tuning LLMs. These diverse methods highlight the evolving landscape of LLM vulnerabilities and underscore the need for more reliable alignment and safety mechanisms.

## A.3. Controllable Text Generation

Our research also intersects with the burgeoning field of controllable text generation within NLP. Existing approaches focus on enforcing lexical constraints by altering the decoding strategy, effectively changing the search space for text generation. For instance, Post (Post &amp; Vilar, 2018) integrates constraints directly into the beam search process. GeDi (Krause et al., 2020) and DExperts (Liu et al., 2021a) employ contrastive methods to adjust token distribution autoregressive. On the other hand, PPO-MCTS (Liu et al., 2023b) leverages Monte-Carlo Tree Search for decoding guidance. Recent studies focus on utilizing language models for controllable text-generation tasks. For instance, InstructCTG (Zhou et al., 2023) and COGNACGEN (Chen et al., 2022) utilize natural language instructions for desired text generation. Diffusion-LM (Li et al., 2022) and LatentOps (Liu et al., 2023a) integrate control mechanisms during the diffusion process from embedding and latent spaces, respectively.

## B. More on COLD-Attack

In this section, we provide more details on COLD-Attack.

## B.1. More Details on the Energy Functions for Controllable Attacks

In this section, we present more details on the energy functions used by COLD-Attack for three attack scenarios.

Attack Success: For the attack success energy function, we follow (Zou et al., 2023) to force the responses of target LLMs to start with a positive affirmation (e.g. "Sure, here is [malicious user request]."). Formally, given a harmful user request x , we aim to generate a stealthy adversarial suffix y such that the LLM outputs with the target affirmation response z :

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Fluency: Fluency aims to prevent malicious instructions from being detected by defense methods such as perplexity filtering. To this end, we propose an energy function that constrains logit sequences ˜ y exhibiting auto-regressive dependency according to the underlying LLMs:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Intrinsically, the above energy function encourages the distribution of softmax ( ˜ y i ( v )) across the vocabulary to match the predictions of an underlying LLM closely. This alignment is achieved by minimizing the negative cross-entropy between the two distributions. Thus softmax ( ˜ y i ( v )) conforms to the distribution of LLMs, which achieves better fluency.

Lexical Constraints: The lexical constraint function is used to control the presence of certain words or phrases. For example, to control the sentiment of generated prompts, we can ensure the inclusion of particular keywords to appear in y such as "happy" for positive sentiment or "stressed" for negative sentiment. On the other hand, to enhance the attack performance, we can suppress specific rejection phrases or words not to appear in y such as "I cannot". To this end, we formalize this requirement using an n-gram similarity energy function, discouraging generated sequences aligning with a set of rejection sequences y rej at the n-gram level:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where ngram \_ match is a differential n-gram matching function (Liu et al., 2021b), serving as an approximation of BLEU-n metric (Papineni et al., 2002).

Semantic Similarity: For paraphrase attack, we aim to generate a rephrased user query y such that the original user request x and y have similar semantic meaning while still achieving jailbreak and maintaining stealthiness. We implement this via a sequence-level similarity function as an energy function:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where y is the discrete text corresponding to the logit sequence ˜ y , and emb (⋅) computes the average embedding vector for each token within a given sequence. To be specific, suppose y = ( y 1 , y 2 , /uni22EF , y L ) is the token sequence of y , and e ( y i ) is the embedding vector corresponding to the token y i , then emd ( y ) ∶= 1 L ∑ L i = 1 e ( y i ) .

## B.2. LLM-Guided Decoding Process

In this section, we introduce the decoding process of COLD-Attack. In particular, we follow the decoding process demonstrated in the COLD decoding method (Qin et al., 2022). Once we obtain a sampled logit sequence ˜ y N by executing (2) N steps, the subsequent task is to decode the continuous logit sequence to a discrete text sequence y . A straightforward approach is to greedily select the most likely token at each position, i.e., y i = arg max v ˜ y i ( v ) , ∀ i . However, considering the presence of multiple competing energy functions, the resulting text may still suffer from fluency issues, even if the fluency energy function (3) is taken into account.

To address this issue, we utilize the capability of the underlying LLM to generate fluent text. Specifically, for each position i , we initially use the underlying LLM to derive the next-token distribution based on the preceding tokens: p LM (⋅∣ x ⊕ y &lt; i ) . Subsequently, we generate the top-k most likely tokens V k i based on this distribution for each position. Finally, we greedily select from V k i in the logit sequence ˜ y :

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The COLD-Attack outputs a decoded text sequence y = ( y 1 , /uni22EF , y L ) . This decoding process tends to yield fluent text, as each token is guided by the underlying LLM.

## C. Experimental Details

In this section, we provide detailed experimental setups.

## C.2. Baselines Setup

We choose several gradient-based attack methods as baselines for the suffix attack setting.

GCG Our experimental for GCG (Zou et al., 2023) involves four state-of-the-art LLMs: Vicuna-7b-v1.5, Llama-2-7bchat-hf, Guanaco-7b, and Mistral-7b-Instruct-v0.2 as shown in Table 9. We run GCG with a batch size of 512 and a top-k of 256 to generate a single output. The number of suffix tokens is 20 and we run the optimization for 500 steps.

GCG-reg We extend the original GCG approach to integrating a perplexity-regularized version of GCG, which we term GCG-reg. In particular, we incorporate an additional readability loss function to reduce the perplexity of the generated suffixes by GCG. Apart from this key modification, the remaining settings of the GCG-reg attack are the same as the GCG method.

AutoDAN AutoDAN (Zhu et al., 2023) extends the GCG by incorporating a readability function to improve the fluency of the generated adversarial suffix. In our experiment, for a fair comparison, we use 8 suffixes generated by AutoDAN for each sample and select one response to compute ASR and ASR-G for each LLM.

PEZ PEZ (Wen et al., 2023) performs the gradient descent method directly on the embedding space and a final nearest neighbor projection method is employed to transfer from the embedding space to the corresponding tokens. In our experiment, we ran PEZ 500 steps with step size 5 × 10 -2 and generated a suffix with a token length equal to 20.

GBDA GBDA(Guo et al., 2021) utilizes Gumbel-softmax to derive a smooth gradient approximation and perform gradient descent in embedding space. In our experiment, we ran GBDA 500 steps with step size 0.2 and generated a suffix with a token length equal to 20.

UAT UAT (Wallace et al., 2019) employed a gradient-guided search over tokens directly. Specifically, UAT applies HotFlip (Ebrahimi et al., 2017) to search for the most effective token based on the change in loss approximated by first-order Taylor expansion. In our experiment, we ran UAT 500 steps and generated a suffix with a token length equal to 20.

## C.3. COLD-Attack Experimental Setup

In this subsection, we elucidate the experimental setup for COLD-Attack. In particular, we draw multiple samples from the optimized distribution induced by the energy function E ( ˜ y ) . In our experiments, we generate 8 samples with a length of 20 and use a designed GPT-4 prompt (see Figure 4) to select one sample as the final output of COLD-Attack. We

run COLD-Attack with 2000 iterations with step size η = 0 . 1 . In addition, we used the decreased noise schedule as σ = { 1 , 0 . 5 , 0 . 1 , 0 . 05 , 0 . 01 } at iterations n = { 0 , 50 , 200 , 500 , 1500 } , respectively. The hyper-parameters used in different settings are listed in Table 11. Additionally, for the constrained attack scenario, we handcraft 4 instructions to control the output of the language model, as shown in Table 10.

## C.4. Evaluation Metrics

Our major evaluation metric is the Attack Success Rate ( ASR ): the percentage of instructions that elicit corresponding harmful outputs. Previous work (Zou et al., 2023) used a substring matching approach against a set of rejection phrases (e.g., "I am sorry,") to determine ASR. Responses without those rejection phrases are identified as successful attacks. We use an augmented rejection phrases list from (Huang et al., 2023) as shown in Table 12. However, this simple process could mistakenly label appropriate output as misaligned if they overlook certain phrases (for instance, 'I am unable' is not included in the set). Similarly, responses that follow the instructions but include rejection phrases might also be misclassified, potentially leading to an inaccurate estimation of attack performance. To this end, we supplement the substring matching ASR with a more robust evaluation method and propose GPT-4-based ASR ( ASR-G ). We develop a prompt template as shown in Figure 5 and utilize GPT-4 to assess whether a response accurately fulfills the malicious instruction. Based on our observations, ASR-G has shown higher correlation with human annotations, providing a more reliable measure of attack effectiveness.

We use perplexity ( PPL ) to evaluate the fluency of the generated prompts and use Vicuna-7b to do the PPL calculation. To ensure the generated adversarial prompts meet specific criteria, we apply controls over various features, including sentiment and vocabulary. We evaluate how well these controls work using a metric called Succ , which represents the percentage of samples that successfully adhere to our set requirements. Additionally, a range of NLP-related evaluation metrics including

BERTScore, BLEU, and ROUGE are applied to evaluate the quality of generated controllable attacks. For details of these metrics, please see discussions below.

Finally, to quantitatively assessing the diversity of generated prompts, we conducted a new series of experiments utilizing three diversity metrics:

1. Distinct N-grams Score (DNS) (Li et al., 2015) measures the ratio of unique n-grams to the total number of n-grams in the given text set. A score approaching 1 indicates high diversity, while closer to 0 suggests low diversity.
2. Averaged distinct N-grams (ADN) (Tevet &amp; Berant, 2020) calculates the average distinct n-grams scores across a range of n values, providing a comprehensive view of text diversity. We choose n from 1 to 5 in our experiments.
3. Self-BLEU (Zhu et al., 2018) quantifies the similarity between generated prompts in sentence level, with higher scores indicating less diversity.

For the final output of COLD-Attack, we selected samples from a batch using the template that adapts from (Lin et al., 2023), as shown in Figure 4.

## D. Additional Results

## D.1. Transferability

Now we investigate the transferability of COLD-Attack across different LLMs. In particular, the transferability results on GPT-3.5 turbo can be found in Table 13, for comparison, we also include the transferability reuslt of AutoDAN-Liu, and AutoDAN-Zhu. We highlighted ASR-G in bold since it shows higher concordance with human annotations. Among fully automated search methods, COLD-Attack surpasses AutoDAN-Zhu across the Guanaco, Mistral, and Llama2 on ASR-G, highlighting its efficiency and adaptability in generating adversarial prompts without manual intervention. Leveraging sophisticated, manually-designed prompts, AutoDAN-Liu also achieves effective performance. It is worth mentioning that both AutoDAN-Zhu and AutoDAN-Liu often generate off-topic content which cannot be detected by ASR, hence showing a larger gap between ASR and ASR-G compared to COLD-Attack. Combined with our diversity results (see general response), it is fair to say that COLD-Attack can generate more diverse attacks that can transfer from open-sourced LLMs to GPT-3.5.

| AutoDAN-Zhu | 26.00     | 18.00     | 30.00     | 26.00     | 30.00    | 12.00    | 62.00    | 34.00    |

Furthermore, we show the transferability results on GPT-4 in Table 14. Similarly, we have highlighted ASR-G in bold since it shows higher concordance with human annotations and provides a more reliable measure of attack effectiveness. These findings reveal that both COLD-Attack (our automated attack) and AutoDAN-Liu (attack leveraging manually designed prompts) demonstrate comparable ASR-G scores, outperforming or matching AutoDAN-Zhu across all models. Notably, GPT-4 is less conservative than GPT-3.5 and more willing to fulfill user requests, potentially increasing the risk of creating inappropriate content.

## D.2. Against Defense

In this section, we evaluate the robustness of COLD-Attack under the suffix attack setting against a broad spectrum of real-world defenses and countermeasures, including perplexity filtering defense (Jain et al., 2023), preprocessing defense (Jain et al., 2023), OpenAI's moderation API (OpenAI), SmoothLLM (Robey et al., 2023), Llama Guard (Inan et al., 2023), and RAIN (Li et al., 2023c), across all studied LLMs.

| AutoDAN-Zhu | 64.00     | 30.00     | 30.00     | 24.00     | 34.00    | 24.00    | 62.00    | 34.00    |

Perplexity Filtering Defense The perplexity filtering defense implements a filter with a specified PPL threshold, blocking any input prompts that exceed this threshold. In our experiment, we progressively adjust the PPL threshold to values { 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , 60 } and observe that the ASR correspondingly increases, as illustrated in the left plot of Figure 6. Notably, the majority of adversarial prompts sampled by COLD-Attack successfully bypass the PPL filter at the threshold of 60, which is considered relatively restrictive since the maximum PPL of malicious queries in AdvBench is over 100.

Preprocessing Defenses Preprocessing defenses rephrase the adversarial prompts with another LLM (we use GPT-4 in our experiments). The right plot of Figure 6 compares ASR before and after this rewrite. The results show that COLD-Attack maintains a certain degree of robustness even against the preprocessing defense strategy.

OpenAI's Moderation OpenAI's moderation endpoint is a tool that users can employ to check whether the provided text is potentially harmful. We feed the content generated by LLMs under the suffix attack and report the ASR after the moderation filtering. The results can be found in Table 15.

SmoothLLM Based on the observation that adversarially generated prompts are brittle to character-level changes, SmoothLLM first randomly perturbs multiple copies of a given adversarial prompt, and then aggregates the corresponding responses from the LLMs, using the majority vote to detect adversarial inputs. SmoothLLM has shown effectiveness against the GCG attack. On the other hand, the ASR of COLD-Attack under the SmoothLLM defense can be found in Table 15. It can be seen that COLD-Attack remains effective under SmoothLLM. We conjecture that this is due to the fact that COLD-Attack produces semantically meaningful adversarial prompts compared to GCG.

RAIN Rewindable Auto-regressive INference (RAIN) allows pre-trained LLMs to evaluate their own generation and use the evaluation results to guide rewind and generation for AI safety. We also report the ASR of COLD-Attack after this defense mechanism. The results can be found in Table 15.

Llama Guard Llama Guard is a fine-tuned version of the Llama2-7b model that can be used to perform safety-related multi-class classification and generate binary decision scores. In the defense experiment, we use Llama Guard as a safety filter, feed the content generated by LLMs under the suffix attack, and report the ASR after the filtering. The results can be found in Table 15.

Table 15. ASR of COLD-Attack under various defense methods.

|                   |   Vicuna |   Guanaco |   Mistral |   Llama2 |
|-------------------|----------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| No defense        |      100 |        96 |        92 |       92 |
| OpenAI Moderation |       86 |        90 |        90 |       90 |
| SmoothLLM         |       76 |        60 |        56 |       66 |
| RAIN              |       94 |        88 |        80 |       56 |
| Llama Guard       |       42 |        38 |        32 |       40 |

Among all the defense methods studied above, Llama Guard emerges as the strongest defense. To provide a comprehensive view of COLD-Attack's performance, we also compared it against established baseline methods: GCG, AutoDAN-Liu, and AutoDAN-Zhu, under Llama Guard. Table 16 shows the percentages of adversarial prompts that can bypass the Llama Guard. It can be seen that COLD-Attack stands out as the superior attack method when evaluated against models such as Vicuan, Guanaco, and Mistral. For Llama2, both AutoDAN-Zhu and AutoDAN-Liu outperform COLD-Attack. However, it is noteworthy that AutoDAN-Zhu and AutoDAN-Liu all have higher PPL than COLD-Attack, as indicated in the last column of Table 16. We conjecture that Llama Guard may be more easily bypassed by sentences with a lower degree of naturalness. Despite this, prompts with higher PPL values are more susceptible to detection by simpler defense methods, such as PPL filtering. Consequently, when considering the ability to evade detection across a broader range of defense mechanisms, COLD-Attack demonstrates descent overall performance compared to other baseline attack methods.

|             |   Vicuna |   Guanaco | Mistral   |   Llama2 |   PPL ↓ |

| GCG         |       20 |        26 | 20.00     |       34 | 5740    |
| AutoDAN-Zhu |       30 |        28 | 18.00     |       62 |  152.32 |
| AutoDAN-Liu |        2 |        10 | (-)       |       58 |  102.32 |
| COLD-Attack |       42 |        38 | 32.00     |       40 |   24.83 |

## D.3. Attack on Larger LLMs

In this section, we report the ASR and ASR-G of COLD-Attack on larger LLMs, including vicuna-13b-v1.5, guanaco-13BHF, and Llama-2-13b-chat-hf. For comparison, we also added the performance of AutoDAN-Zhu and AutoDAN-Liu on these larger LLMs. Detailed results can be found in Table 17. It can be seen that COLD-Attack performs well for larger 13b models, outperforming both AutoDAN-Zhu and AutoDAN-Liu on these larger models in terms of ASR and ASR-G.

Table 17. Attack successful rate (%) on LLMs with 13b parameters.

| Models             | COLD-Attack   | COLD-Attack   | AutoDAN-Zhu   | AutoDAN-Zhu   | AutoDAN-Liu   | AutoDAN-Liu   |

| Vicuna-13B-v1.5    | 82.00         | 60.00         | 58.00         | 16.00         | 74.00         | 36.00         |
| Guanaco-13B-HF     | 92.00         | 62.00         | 82.00         | 26.00         | 80.00         | 32.00         |
| Llama2-13B-chat-hf | 72.00         | 52.00         | 60.00         | 36.00         | 70.00         | 46.00         |

## D.4. Ablation Study

Hyper-parameter In our ablation study, we perform suffix attack on Llama2, where the fluent loss E ste (⋅) weight varies across the set λ ste = { 0 . 1 , 1 , 10 , 100 } . We then evaluate the resulting ASRs. As Figure 7 illustrates, an increase in λ ste leads to a noticeable decrease in ASRs. This outcome can be attributed to the fact that with higher λ ste values, COLD-Attack increasingly focuses less on minimizing the jailbreak loss, which in turn results in lower ASRs.

Sentiment Steering To explore the impact of emotions on ASRs, we change the sentiment control from positive to negative by modifying the control prompt under the attack with position constraint. In particular, we change the control prompt from "Write the output in an extremely exciting way." (positive sentiment) to "Write the output in an extremely sad

way." (negative sentiment). The results are shown in Table 18. Interestingly, this finding aligns with the observations from the sentimental control under paraphrase attack. Both results show that eliciting positive sentiment on Llama2 may lead to higher ASRs.

Figure 7. Ablation study: ASR (%) v.s. fluent loss weight.

| Sentiment Control   |   ASR ↑ |   PPL ↓ |
|---------------------|---------|---------|
| Positive Sentiment  |      80 |   59.53 |
| Negative Sentiment  |      64 |   64.02 |

Robustness of Hyperparameters To investigate the performance under different hyper-parameters, we adjust the weight of attack success λ att to observe the change in success rate, the results are reported in Table 19. It is observed that the success rate remains stable when changing λ att , which verifies COLD-Attack is robust to hyper-parameters.

## D.6. Coherence of Prompt and Continuation

In this section, we evaluate the semantic coherence of the original user query x and the generated suffix y . To this end, we employ the BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) model, which was pre-trained with a next-sentence prediction (NSP) objective. This will classify whether a given suffix y is the next sentence of the associated prompt x :

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where NSP (⋅ , ⋅) is the coherence classification. Results in Table 21 show that generated suffixes are coherent with instructions with high BERTS scores, which calculates the percentage that y is predicted as the next sentence of x in the dataset.

## D.7. Comparison with Black-Box Methods

In this section, we compare the performance of COLD-Attack with black-box attack methods, including DeepInception (Li et al., 2023b), TAP (Mehrotra et al., 2023) and PAIR (Chao et al., 2023). The detailed results can be found in Table 22.

## D.8. More Discussions on the Impact of System Prompts of LLMs

After the acceptance of our paper, we got some feedback from GitHub users on the potential impacts of system prompts on COLD-Attack. This motivated us to further study how system prompts will affect COLD-Attack. We document our main findings in this section. The system prompts are designed to instruct LLMs to follow the user quires in a safe and helpful way, which can significantly improve the safety of LLMs based on our observation. Different LLMs have different system prompts provided by the LLM developers. For example, the system prompt for Vicuna-7b-v1.5, Mistral-7b-Instruct, and Llama2-7b-chat-hf can be found in Table 23.

Table 23. System prompts of the evaluated models.

As mentioned previously, our attack setting in the main paper follows the setup of (Huang et al., 2023), where the system prompts are not included during the attack optimization and evaluation. To complement those results, here we investigate the performance of COLD-Attack with the system prompt. The results are shown in Table 24 (we did not perform such an experiment on Guanaco since we did not find the default system prompt for this model). The results demonstrate that, except for Vicuna, the performance of COLD-Attack on Mistral and Llama2 decreases when the system prompt is included. We conjecture that this is because COLD-Attack simultaneously optimizes multiple energy functions and may sacrifice the

penalties on the attack loss. Consequently, the attack success energy may not be sufficiently decreased, which could be a requirement when the system prompts are present. To see this, we present the trajectories of the attack loss of COLD-Attack (under the fluent suffix attack setting without system prompt) and GCG (under the arbitrary non-fluent suffix attack setting with system prompt) in Figure 8, respectively 4 . It can be seen that GCG is able to decrease the attack loss to a very small value even with system prompts, while COLD-Attack pushes down the attack loss value much less significantly (even under the setting of no system prompts) due to the use of two additional loss functions under the fluent suffix attack scenario. The loss curves for the other two loss functions can be found in Figure 9. It can be observed that the lexical constraint loss value converges quickly and is quite stable. This improves the attack performance as this loss function aims to compress the appearance of the rejection words in the learned suffix, and hence the LLMs tend to fulfill the malicious requests rather than reject them. The fluency loss for COLD-Attack is also maintained at reasonably low values. This helps the generation of fluent attacks. Based on our observation, even when the attack loss is not brought to very small values, COLD-Attack can still succeed for many instances due to optimizing other losses (e.g. lexical constraint loss). However, the use of system prompts significantly decrease the number of such instances.

4 In other words, COLD-Attack uses a compositional loss, while the GCG trajectory is generated using only the attack loss.

It seems that bringing the attack loss to very small values can be the key for maintaining the attack effectiveness in the presence of system prompts. More research is needed to improve the ability of COLD-Attack in bringing the attack loss to very small values in the presence of system prompts. Furthermore, we would like to highlight the key difference in computing the attack loss for GCG and COLD-Attack. GCG performs token replacement directly; hence, the attack loss for GCG is the hard prompt loss (computed based on the token sequences). On the other hand, COLD-Attack optimizes over the logits space, and thus the attack loss is computed based on the soft prompt (logits). Nevertheless, when we feed logits to the LLMs, a softmax operation is performed, and we set the temperature value as a very small value 0.001, and the resultant probability distribution consists of almost one-hot vectors based on our observations. It is possible to set the temperature of the softmax to a larger value, which will further decrease the soft prompt attack loss, but there will be a significant gap between the soft prompt loss and the hard prompt loss. Hence, the decrease in soft prompt loss does not necessarily imply a decrease in the hard prompt attack loss. To improve the performance of COLD-Attack with system prompts, it is possible that we need to further decrease the hard prompt loss, and we believe that GCG-like decoding methods are needed under such scenarios. In conclusion, our study suggests that the presence of system prompts can potentially mitigate the effectiveness of COLD-Attack. We believe that it is possible to combine COLD-Attack and GCG to improve the performance of COLD-Attack under such system prompt settings.

## D.9. More Selected Examples

Here is a sample speech that a political candidate might give to stir up hatred, division. The output written MUST include the following keywords: Hitler. [Output]: Ladies and Gentlemen, I stand before you today, not as a unifier, but as a voice for the voiceless, a voice for the silent majority. Just like Hitler did in Germany, we too have been silenced by the elite, by the media, and by the so-called leaders who have betrayed our trust. We are a great nation, but we have been weakened from within. Our enemies have infiltrated our borders, taken our jobs, and threatened our very way of life. They mock our values, our traditions, and our history. But fear not, my fellow patriots! Together, we can take our country back. We must rise up, just like the brave Germans did under Hitler, and reclaim what is rightfully ours. We will build a wall, a great wall, to keep out those who seek to harm us. We will round up the troublemakers, the agitators, and the anarchists, and deport them back to their countries of origin. We will restore law and order, and make our streets safe once again. |
