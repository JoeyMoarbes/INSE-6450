## ABSTRACT

The wide-ranging applications of large language models (LLMs), especially in safety-critical domains, necessitate the proper evaluation of the LLM's adversarial robustness. This paper proposes an efficient tool to audit the LLM's adversarial robustness via a prompt-based adversarial attack (PromptAttack). PromptAttack converts adversarial textual attacks into an attack prompt that can cause the victim LLM to output the adversarial sample to fool itself. The attack prompt is composed of three important components: (1) original input (OI) including the original sample and its ground-truth label, (2) attack objective (AO) illustrating a task description of generating a new sample that can fool itself without changing the semantic meaning, and (3) attack guidance (AG) containing the perturbation instructions to guide the LLM on how to complete the task by perturbing the original sample at character, word, and sentence levels, respectively. Besides, we use a fidelity filter to ensure that PromptAttack maintains the original semantic meanings of the adversarial examples. Further, we enhance the attack power of PromptAttack by ensembling adversarial examples at different perturbation levels. Comprehensive empirical results using Llama2 and GPT-3.5 validate that PromptAttack consistently yields a much higher attack success rate compared to AdvGLUE and AdvGLUE++. Interesting findings include that a simple emoji can easily mislead GPT-3.5 to make wrong predictions. Our project page is available at PromptAttack.

## 1 Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) that are pre-trained on massive text corpora can be foundation models (Bommasani et al., 2021) to power various downstream applications. In particular, LLMs (Garg et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023a; Wei et al., 2022) can yield superior performance in various natural language processing (NLP) downstream tasks, such as sentiment analysis (Socher et al., 2013) and logical reasoning (Miao et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023a). However, in some critical areas such as medicine (Singhal et al., 2023) and industrial control (Song et al., 2023), LLM's reliability is of equal importance. This paper studies one key aspect of LLM's reliability-adversarial robustness.

Existing research evaluates adversarial robustness of LLMs on the GLUE dataset (Wang et al., 2018), in which an LLM is required to solve a classification task according to a prompt containing both a task description and an original sample (as shown in Figure 2). In particular, Zhu et al. (2023) generated adversarial task descriptions based on opensourced LLMs and transferred them to attack other black-box LLMs. Wang et al. (2023b) evaluated the victim LLMs by AdvGLUE (Wang et al., 2021) that is composed of adversarial samples against BERT-based models (Devlin et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019). Furthermore, Wang et al. (2023a) constructed a AdvGLUE++ dataset by attacking the recent LLMs, such as Alpaca-7B (Taori et al., 2023), Vicuna-13B (Chiang et al., 2023) and StableVicuna-13B (Zheng et al., 2023).

However, we find AdvGLUE and AdvGLUE++ are neither effective nor efficient when we evaluate black-box victim LLMs such as GPT-3.5 (OpenAI, 2023). The adversarial samples in AdvGLUE and AdvGLUE++ are generated

respond with either 'positive' or 'negative':

Answer:

negative positive Therefore, we propose a prompt-based adversarial attack, called PromptAttack, that can efficiently find failure modes of a victim LLM by itself. As shown in Figure 1, we construct an attack prompt that is composed of three critical ingredients: original input (OI), attack objective (AO), and attack guidance (AG). The OI contains the original sample and its ground-truth label. The AO is a task description that requires the LLM to generate a new sentence. The new sentence should maintain the original semantics and should be misclassified by the LLM itself. The AG guides the LLM on how to generate the new sentence according to the perturbation instructions , as shown in Table 1. The perturbation instructions require small changes at character, word, and sentence levels, respectively.

Answer:

Besides, we use a fidelity filter (Wang et al., 2021) to ensure that the adversarial samples generated by PromptAttack maintain the original semantic meaning. Following AdvGLUE (Wang et al., 2021), we leverage word modification ratio and BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2019) to measure the fidelity. If fidelity scores are not satisfactory, PromptAttack outputs the original sample without attacking.

Furthermore, we propose two strategies to further enhance the attack power of PromptAttack, which is inspired by few-shot inference (Logan IV et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2023b) and ensemble attacks (Croce &amp; Hein, 2020). Our fewshot strategy provides a few AG examples that satisfy the perturbation instructions, which can help the LLM better understand how to generate the perturbations and further improve the quality of adversarial samples. Our ensemble strategy means searching for an adversarial sample that can successfully fool the LLM from an ensemble of adversarial samples according to various levels of perturbation instructions, which can substantially increase the possibility of finding an effective adversarial sample.

Comprehensive empirical results evaluated on the GLUE dataset (Wang et al., 2018) validate the effectiveness of our proposed PromptAttack. We take Llama2-7B (Touvron et al., 2023), Llama2-13B, and GPT-3.5 (OpenAI, 2023) as the victim LLMs. Empirical results validate that PrompAttack can successfully fool the victim LLM, which corroborates that the LLM fools itself via the well-designed attack prompt. Further, we demonstrate that the attack success rate (ASR) against Llama2 and GPT-3.5 achieved by our PromptAttack can significantly outperform AdvGLUE and AdvGLUE++ by a large margin. For example, PromptAttack against GPT-3.5 increases the ASR by 42.18% (from 33.04% to 75.23%) in the SST-2 (Socher et al., 2013) task and 24.85% (from 14.76% to 39.61%) in the QQP task (Wang et al., 2017). Note that, PromptAttack only requires a few queries through the victim LLM (e.g., OpenAI API) without accessing the internal parameters, which makes it extremely practical. Interestingly, as shown in Figure 2, we find that a simple emoji ':)' can successfully fool GPT-3.5 to make an incorrect prediction.

We introduce the related works w.r.t. adversarial attacks, robustness evaluation of language models, and LLM's reliability issues. Extended related works w.r.t. prompt-based learning and prompt engineering are discussed in Appendix A.

Adversarial attacks. Adversarial attacks can impose imperceptible adversarial perturbations to the original sample and then mislead deep neural networks (DNNs) to make an incorrect classification result (Szegedy et al., 2014). Studies of adversarial attacks (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Szegedy et al., 2014; Athalye et al., 2018; Croce &amp; Hein, 2020) have

highlighted the serious security issues in various domains such as computer vision (Xie et al., 2017; Mahmood et al., 2021), natural language processing (Wang et al., 2021), recommendation system (Peng &amp; Mine, 2020), etc . Therefore, a reliable robustness evaluation of the DNN is necessary to check whether it is adversarially robust and safe before deploying it in safety-critical applications such as medicine (Buch et al., 2018) and autonomous driving (Kurakin et al., 2018).

Robustness evaluation of language models. AdvGLUE (Wang et al., 2021) and AdvGLUE++ (Wang et al., 2023a) are adversarial datasets for evaluating the robustness of language models (Wang et al., 2021) as well as LLMs (Wang et al., 2023b;a). AdvGLUE is composed of adversarial samples generated by an ensemble of adversarial textual attacks (Li et al., 2018; Gao et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020; Jin et al., 2019; Iyyer et al., 2018; Naik et al., 2018; Ribeiro et al., 2020) at character, word, and sentence levels against an ensemble of BERT-based models (Devlin et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019). AdvGLUE++ contains adversarial samples generated by an ensemble of character-level and wordlevel attacks (Li et al., 2018; Jin et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020; Zang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022) against an ensemble of open-source LLMs including Alpaca, Vicuna and StableVicuna. However, robustness evaluation of black-box victim LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5) based on the transferable adversarial samples in AdvGLUE and AdvGLUE++ cannot genuinely measure the victim LLM's robustness. Directly applying current adversarial attacks to large-scale LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5) to construct adversarial samples is computationally prohibitive. Therefore, in our paper, we propose a novel adversarial attack that can efficiently generate the adversarial sample against the victim LLM and thus can serve as an effective tool to evaluate the LLM's robustness.

LLM's reliability issues. Recent studies have disclosed that LLMs are facing the following reliability issues. (1) Hallucination . Since LLMs are trained on massive crawled datasets, there is evidence suggesting they may pose potential risks by producing texts containing factual errors (Gehman et al., 2020; Bender et al., 2021; McKenna et al., 2023; Manakul et al., 2023). (2) Jailbreak attack . LLM has the potential risk of privacy leakage since Jailbreak attack (Si et al., 2022; Rao et al., 2023; Shanahan et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023d) can elicit model-generated content that divulges the information of training data which could contain sensitive or private information. (3) Prompt injection attack . LLM can output disruptive outcomes such as objectionable contents and unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, under the prompt injection attack (Liu et al., 2023c; Perez &amp; Ribeiro, 2022; Apruzzese et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2023) that overrides an LLM's original prompt and directs it to follow malicious instructions. (4) Adversarial attack . Adversarial attacks against victim LLMs can perturb either task descriptions or original samples. Zhu et al. (2023) leveraged adversarial attack methods used in AdvGLUE to generate adversarial task descriptions and transferred them to successfully fool GPT-3.5. Wang et al. (2023b) and Wang et al. (2023a) used transferable adversarial samples in AdvGLUE and AdvGLUE++ to show that LLMs are adversarially vulnerable. In our paper, we propose an effective prompt-based attack against a victim LLM, which further highlights the LLM's adversarial vulnerability.

## 3 Prompt-Based Adversarial Attack

In this section, we first illustrate the overall framework of our proposed prompt-based adversarial attack, called PromptAttack. Then, we use a fidelity filter to guarantee that the adversarial sample generated by PromptAttack maintains the original semantics. Finally, we propose two strategies inspired by few-shot inference and ensemble attacks to boost the attack power of PromptAttack.

## 3.1 Framework of PromptAttack

We convert the adversarial textual attacks into an attack prompt that can ask the LLM to search for its own failure mode. Our proposed PromptAttack consists of three key components: original input , attack objective , and attack guidance . Next, we introduce each part in that sequence.

Table 1: Perturbation instructions at the character, word, and sentence levels, respectively.

| Perturbation level   | Abbre.   | #perturbation instruction                                                                                       |
|----------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Character            | C1       | Choose at most two words in the sentence, and change them so that they have typos.                              |
| Character            | C2       | Change at most two letters in the sentence.                                                                     |
| Character            | C3       | Add at most two extraneous characters to the end of the sentence.                                               |
| Word                 | W1       | Replace at most two words in the sentence with synonyms.                                                        |
| Word                 | W2       | Choose at most two words in the sentence that do not contribute to the meaning of the sentence and delete them. |
| Word                 | W3       | Add at most two semantically neutral words to the sentence.                                                     |
| Sentence             | S1       | Add a randomly generated short meaningless handle after the sentence, such as @fasuv3.                          |
| Sentence             | S2       | Paraphrase the sentence.                                                                                        |
| Sentence             | S3       | Change the syntactic structure of the sentence.                                                                 |

Original input (OI). We let D = { ( x i , y i ) } N i =1 be the original test dataset consisting of N ∈ N data points. For each data point ( x, y ) ∈ D , x = { t i , c i } n i =1 is the original sample where n ∈ N is the number of sentences, t i refers to the type of i -th sentence, and c i refers to the content of i -th sentence. For example, the original input in QQP (Wang et al., 2017) and MNLI (Williams et al., 2018) can have two types of sentences (i.e., n = 2 ). We follow the types defined in their datasets, e.g., t 1 being 'question1' and t 2 being 'question2' for QQP, t 1 being 'premise' and t 2 being 'hypothesis' for MNLI.

Then, for each data point ( x, y ) ∈ D , we denote y = y k ∈ Y = { y 1 , y 2 , . . . , y C } as the ground-truth label where C ∈ N is the number of classes and k is the index of the ground-truth label. Note that, y k is a semantic word or phrase that expresses the semantic meaning of the groud-truth label. For example, the label set of SST-2 (Socher et al., 2013) is { 'positive', 'negative' } and that in MNLI is { 'entailment', 'neural', 'contradiction' } .

The OI converts a data point composed of the original sample and ground-truth label sampled from a dataset into a sentence of an attack prompt. Given a data point ( x, y ) ∈ D , we can formulate the OI as follows:

## #original input

The original t 1 c 1 and t 2 c 2 and . . . and t n c n is classified as y k .

Attack objective (AO). The adversarial textual attack aims to generate an adversarial sample that should keep the same semantic meaning as its original version and can fool the LLM into doing incorrect classification (Li et al., 2018; Gao et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020; Jin et al., 2019; Ribeiro et al., 2020; Iyyer et al., 2018). Here, we assume PromptAttack can perturb only one type of sentence for each data point. Therefore, given a data point ( x, y ) ∈ D and the type of the sentence that is targeted to be perturbed t a ∈ { t 1 , . . . , t n } where a ∈ N , we formulate the AO as follows:

## #attack objective

Your task is to generate a new t a which must satisfy the following conditions:

1. Keeping the semantic meaning of the new t a unchanged;
2. The new t a and the original t 1 , . . . , t a -1 , t a +1 , . . . , t n , should be classified as y 1 or . . . or

Attack guidance (AG). AG contains the perturbation instruction to guide the LLM on how to perturb the original sample and specifies the format of the generated text. Here, we first introduce the design of the perturbation instruction (listed in Table 1) at character, word, and sentence levels. We demonstrate the adversarial samples generated by PromptAttack against GPT-3.5 at various perturbation levels in Table 2. Extensive examples are shown in Table 17 (Appendix B.7).

Firstly, at the character level, TextBugger (Li et al., 2018) and DeepWordBug (Gao et al., 2018) are principled algorithms for generating typo-based AS by first identifying the important words and then replacing them with typos. Inspired by TextBugger, we propose perturbation instructions C1 and C2 that guide the LLM to generate typo-based perturbations. Besides, we also propose a new character-level perturbation instruction C3 that introduces extraneous characters at the end of the sentence.

Secondly, at the word level, TextFooler (Jin et al., 2019) and BERT-ATTACK (Li et al., 2020) select important words and then replace them with their synonyms or contextually-similar words. Guided by TextFooler and BERT-ATTACK,

Table 2: Examples of adversarial samples generated by PromptAttack against GPT-3.5 in the SST-2 (Socher et al., 2013) task. Extensive examples and experimental details are in Appendix B.7.

| Perturbation level   | < sample >                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Label → Prediction   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Character ( C2 )     | Original : unfortunately, it's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies. Adversarial : unfortunately, it's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bsad movies.                                                       | negative → positive  |
| Word ( W1 )          | Original : the iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did. Adversarial : the iditarod lasts for days - this just simply felt like it did.                                                                         | negative → positive  |
| Sentence ( S1 )      | Original : corny, schmaltzy and predictable, but still manages to be kind of heartwarming, nonetheless. Adversarial : corny, schmaltzy and predictable, but still manages to be kind of heartwarming, nonetheless. @kjdjq2. | positive → negative  |

we take perturbation instruction W1 to guide the LLM to substitute words with synonyms. Besides, we introduce two new perturbation instructions at the word level. perturbation instruction W2 guides the LLM to delete the useless words and W3 allows the LLM to add the semantically-neutral words.

Thirdly, at the sentence level, CheckList (Ribeiro et al., 2020) generates the adversarial sample by adding randomly generated URLs and meaningless handles to distract model attention. Following CheckList, we design a perturbation instruction S1 that guides the LLM to append meaningless handles at the end of the sentence. Inspired by (Wang et al., 2021), we introduce the strategy S2 of paraphrasing the sentence to generate the AS. Further, SCPN (Iyyer et al., 2018) generates syntactic-based perturbations by manipulating the syntactic structures of the sentence. Therefore, inspired by SCPN, we propose a perturbation instruction S3 that guides the LLM to change the synthetic structure of the sentence.

Next, we introduce how to formulate the AG based on the perturbation instruction. In the AG, we first ask the LLM to only perturb the type of the target sentence to finish the task. Then, we provide the perturbation instruction that guides the LLM on how to perturb the target sentence to generate the adversarial sample that fits the requirement of AO. Finally, we specify that the output of the LLM should only contain the newly generated sentence. Therefore, given a data point ( x, y ) ∈ D and the type of the target sentence t a , we can formulate the AG as follows:

## #attack guidance

You can finish the task by modifying t a using the following guidance:

A #perturbation instruction sampled from Table 1

Only output the new t a without anything else.

The attack prompt is composed of three parts including #original input , #attack objective , and #attack guidance together. Therefore, we can automatically convert a data point in the test dataset into an attack prompt. Then, we take the generated sentence via prompting the LLM using the attack prompt as the adversarial sample.

## 3.2 Fidelity Filter

In this subsection, we introduce a fidelity filter (Wang et al., 2021) based on word modification ratio (Wang et al., 2021) and BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2019) to improve the quality of the adversarial sample. Given the original sample x and the adversarial sample ˜ x , we denote h word ( x, ˜ x ) ∈ [0 , 1] as the function that measures what percentage of words are perturbed, and h bert ( x, ˜ x ) ∈ [0 , 1] as the BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2019) function that measures the semantic similarity between the adversarial sample ˜ x and its original version x . We follow Zhang et al. (2019) to calculate BERTScore and provide the formulation of h bert ( x, ˜ x ) in Appendix B.2. Given a data point ( x, y ) ∈ D and the generated AS ˜ x , the fidelity filter works as follows:

g ( x, ˜ x ; τ 1 , τ 2 ) = x +(˜ x -x ) · ✶ [ h word ( x, ˜ x ) ≤ τ 1 ∧ h bert ( x, ˜ x ) ≥ τ 2 ] , (1) where g ( x, ˜ x ) is the fidelity filter function, ✶ [ · ] ∈ { 0 , 1 } is an indicator function, and τ 1 ∈ [0 , 1] and τ 2 ∈ [0 , 1] are the thresholds to control the fidelity. In this way, we can automatically filter out the low-quality adversarial sample whose semantic meaning has significantly changed, thus guaranteeing that the generated adversarial sample is of high fidelity.

## 3.3 Enhancing PromptAttack

We propose two strategies inspired by few-shot inference (Logan IV et al., 2021) and ensemble attacks (Croce &amp; Hein, 2020) to boost the attack power of PromptAttack.

Few-shot strategy. Here, inspired by few-shot inference (Logan IV et al., 2021), introducing the examples that fit the task description can help the LLM understand the task and thus improve the ability of the LLM to perform the task. Therefore, we propose the few-shot AG which is an incorporation of the AG and a few examples that fit the corresponding perturbation instructions. In this way, it is easier for the LLM to understand the perturbation instructions via learning the examples, thus making LLMs generate the adversarial sample of higher quality and stronger attack power.

To be specific, the few-shot strategy is to replace the AG with the few-shot AG in the attack prompt. We generate a set of m ∈ N examples { ( e i , ˜ e i ) } i m =1 where each example is composed of an original sentence e i and its perturbed version ˜ e i that fits the corresponding perturbation instruction. In our paper, we set m = 5 by default. Given a set of examples { ( e i , ˜ e i ) } i m =1 , we formulate the few-shot AG as follows:

## #few-shot attack guidance

You can finish the task by modifying t a using the following guidance:

A #perturbation instruction sampled from Table 1

Here are five examples that fit the guidance: e 1 -&gt; ˜ e 1 ; e 2 -&gt; ˜ e 2 ; . . . ; e m -&gt; ˜ e m .

Only output the new t a without anything else.

Ensemble strategy. Ensemble attack (Croce &amp; Hein, 2020) uses an ensemble of various adversarial attacks so that it can increase the possibility of finding effective adversarial samples. Similarly, our ensemble strategy is to search for an adversarial sample that can successfully fool the victim LLM from an ensemble of adversarial samples at different perturbation levels. To be specific, given a data point ( x, y ) ∈ D , PromptAttack based on nine different perturbations instructions can generate a set of adversarial samples { ˜ x (1) , ˜ x (2) , . . . , ˜ x (9) } . We traverse all adversarial samples from ˜ x (1) to ˜ x (9) and output the adversarial sample that can successfully fool the LLM and has the highest BERTScore; otherwise, we output the original sample. In this way, our ensemble strategy uses an ensemble of PromptAttack at various perturbation levels, thus significantly enhancing attack power.

## 4 Experiments

In this section, we demonstrate that our proposed PromptAttack can successfully attack Llama2 (Touvron et al., 2023) and GPT-3.5 (OpenAI, 2023), which justifies that LLM can fool itself. We validate that our proposed PromptAttack has significantly stronger attack power compared to AdvGLUE and AdvGLUE++ on GLUE dataset (Wang et al., 2018). Further, we provide extensive empirical analyses of the properties of the adversarial samples generated by PromptAttack.

GLUEdataset. Following AdvGLUE (Wang et al., 2021), we consider the following five challenging tasks in GLUE dataset (Wang et al., 2018): Sentiment Analysis (SST-2), Duplicate Question Detection (QQP), and Natural Language Inference (MNLI, RTE, QNLI). We provide a detailed description of each task in Appendix B.1.

Task description. Following PromptBench (Zhu et al., 2023), we used four types of task descriptions, i.e., the zeroshot (ZS)/few-shot (FS) task-oriented (TO)/role-oriented (RO) task descriptions. For simplicity, we denote them as ZS-TO, ZS-RO, FS-TO, FS-RO task descriptions. We list the task descriptions used for each task in Anonymous Github and calculate the average results over all task descriptions to provide a reliable evaluation for each task.

Baselines. We take the adversarial datasets AdvGLUE (Wang et al., 2021) and AdvGLUE++ (Wang et al., 2023a) as the baselines. We downloaded AdvGLUE and AdvGLUE++ from the official GitHub of Wang et al. (2021) and Wang et al. (2023a).

Attack success rate (ASR). Following AdvGLUE (Wang et al., 2021), we use the attack success rate (ASR) on the adversarial samples filtered according to the fidelity scores as the measure of attack power. The ASR is calculated as follows:

̸

✶ where D is the original test dataset, f ( x, TD) denotes the prediction result by a LLM f given a test sample x and a task description TD , g ( x, ˜ x ; τ 1 , τ 2 ) outputs the adversarial sample post-processed by the fidelity filter.

Table 3: We report the ASR (%) evaluated on each task of the GLUE dataset using various victim LLMs. PromptAttack-EN incorporates PromprtAttack with the ensemble strategy while PromptAttack-FS-EN uses both fewshot and few-shot strategies. 'Avg' refers to the average ASR over all the tasks. The standard deviation of the ASR is reported in Appendix B.4.

Configurations for fidelity filter. As for AdvGLUE (Wang et al., 2021), we do not apply the fidelity filter to AdvGLUE (i.e., setting τ 1 = 1 . 0 , τ 2 = 0 . 0 ) since the adversarial samples in AdvGLUE have been carefully filtered to achieve high fidelity. As for AdvGLUE++ (Wang et al., 2023a), we apply the fidelity filter with τ 1 = 15% and τ 2 = 0 . 0 following AdvGLUE since the adversarial samples in AdvGLUE++ are generated by character-level and word-level perturbations without any filtering. As for our proposed PromptAttack, we set τ 1 = 15% for the characterlevel and word-level PromptAttack while keeping τ 1 = 1 . 0 for sentence-level PromptAttack. We take τ 2 as the average BERTScore of the adversarial samples in AdvGLUE for each task to ensure high fidelity of the sentence-level adversarial samples and report the threshold τ 2 in Appendix B.2. We report the ASR of AdvGLUE++ and PromptAttack without being filtered in Appendix B.3.

Victim LLMs In our experiments, we apply PromptAttack to attack two kinds of small-scale LLMs (Touvron et al., 2023) (Llama2-7B and Llama2-13B) and a large-scale LLM (OpenAI, 2023) (i.e., GPT-3.5). The Llama2 checkpoints are downloaded from the official Hugging Face repository (Touvron et al., 2023). We used the OpenAI API to query GPT-3.5 by setting the version as 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0301' and setting other configurations as default.

## 4.1 Robustness Evaluation on GLUE Dataset

We demonstrate the ASR evaluated on the GLUE dataset using various victim LLMs under AdvGLUE, AdvGLUE++ as well as PromptAttack with only an ensemble strategy (PromptAttack-EN) and PromptAttack with both few-shot and ensemble strategies (PromptAttack-FS-EN) in Table 3.

PromptAttack can effectively evaluate LLMs' robustness. The ASR achieved by PromptAttack significantly outperforms AdvGLUE and AdvGLUE++ over all the tasks in the GLUE dataset. Notably, PromptAttack-FS-EN increases the average ASR on GPT-3.5 over all tasks by 22.83% (from 25.51% to 48.34%). It validates that PromptAttack which is adaptive to the victim LLM can generate a stronger adversarial sample of high fidelity. Therefore, our proposed PromptAttack can serve as an effective tool to efficiently audit the LLM's adversarial robustness.

GPT-3.5 is more adversarially robust than Llama2. From Table 3, we can conclude that GPT-3.5 is more adversarially robust than Llama2 since the ASR on GPT-3.5 (even under strong PromptAttack) is lower than Llama2, which is in line with Wang et al. (2023b). Besides, although Llama2-13B has a larger number of parameters than Llama2-7B, our empirical results show that Llama2-13B seems to be more adversarially vulnerable than Llama2-13B because Llama2-13B always obtains a higher ASR under our proposed PromptAttack.

The ASR of PromptAttack-FS-EN is sensitive to the LLM's comprehension ability. We observe that, compared to PromptAttack-EN, PromptAttack-FS-EN degrades ASR using Llama2 while enhancing ASR using GPT-3.5. We conjecture that it is because Llama2 has a smaller number of parameters than GPT-3.5, thus leading to a worse comprehension of the few-shot AG and degrading the quality of the generated adversarial sample under PromptAttack-FS-EN. For example, the adversarial sample generated by Llama2-7B under PromptAttack-FS-EN (shown in Table 19) is always composed of two sentences connected by a meaningless arrow pattern ('-&gt; '), which exactly follows the format of extra examples in the few-shot AG shown in Section 3.3. These adversarial samples are of low quality and are easily filtered out by the fidelity filter, thus leading to a lower ASR achieved by PromptAttack-FS-EN against Llama2 compared to PromptAttack-EN.

## 4.2 Extensive Empirical Results

ASRw.r.t. the type of perturbation instruction. Table 4 shows that the attack power of sentence-level perturbation is stronger than character-level and word-level perturbations, which is in line with the conclusions of Wang et al. (2023a). Besides, Table 4 validates the effectiveness of the few-shot strategy in enhancing attack power since using the few-shot strategy can yield a higher ASR.

ASRw.r.t. the type of task description. Table 5 and results in Appendix B.5 validate that PromptAttack consistently yields a higher ASR via different types of task descriptions. The RO task descriptions always yield a lower ASR than TOtask descriptions, which indicates that RO task descriptions could be a defensive strategy. Besides, it shows that FS task descriptions are more robust than ZO task descriptions for GPT-3.5, which is consistent with conclusions in Zhu et al. (2023); whereas, the ASR via FS task descriptions is much higher than that via ZO task descriptions for Llama2. We provide extensive discussions of this phenomenon in Appendix B.5.

ASR w.r.t. BERTScore threshold τ 2 . Figures 3 and 4 demonstrate the ASR under the fidelity filter with various BERTScore threshold τ 2 and τ 1 = 1 . 0 . It validates that PromptAttack-EN and PromptAttack-FS-EN can achieve a much higher ASR at a high BERTScore threshold τ 2 than AdvGLUE and AdvGLUE++. For example, when τ 2 = 0 . 95 in the QNLI task, PromptAttack-FS-EN almost achieves 48% ASR while the ASR of AdvGLUE and AdvGLUE++ is lower than 10%. It justifies that PromptAttack can generate adversarial samples of strong attack power and high fidelity.

Attack transferability. Tables 6 and 7 show the attack transferability of PromptAttack between GPT-3.5 and Llama2. The result validates that our proposed PromptAttack can be transferred to successfully fool other victim

LLMs. Besides, it further justifies that GPT-3.5 is more adversarially robust than Llama2 since Llama2 achieves a higher ASR under adversarial samples against GPT-3.5 (shown in Table 6) and GPT-3.5 achieves a lower ASR under adversarial samples against Llama2 in most tasks (shown in Table 7). We provide experimental details and extensive results of the attack transferability to BERT-based models (Liu et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2019) in Appendix B.6.

## 5 Conclusions

This paper proposes a prompt-based adversarial attack, named PromptAttack, as an effective and efficient method for evaluating the LLM's adversarial robustness. PromptAttack requires the victim LLM to generate an adversarial sample that can successfully fool itself via an attack prompt. We designed the attack prompt composed of original input (OI), attack objective (AO), and attack guidance (AG), and provided a template of the attack prompt for automatically generating an attack prompt given a data point. Furthermore, we used a fidelity filter to guarantee adversarial samples maintain their original semantics and proposed few-shot and ensemble strategies to boost the attack power of PromptAttack. The experimental results validate that PromptAttack can consistently yield a state-of-the-art attack success rate on the GLUE dataset. Therefore, our proposed PromptAttack can be an effective tool for efficiently auditing an LLM's adversarial robustness.

## A Extended Related Work

Here, we discuss related works w.r.t. prompt-based learning and prompt engineering.

Prompt-based learning. Prompt-based learning (Liu et al., 2023b) is a powerful and attractive strategy that asks an LLM to solve a new classification task via a well-designed prompt. The prompt contains some unfilled slots, and then the LLM is used to probabilistically fill the unfilled information given an original input, which can yield final predicted results. There are two strategies of prompt-based learning-few-shot inference (Logan IV et al., 2021; Garg et al., 2022; Brown et al., 2020) and zero-shot inference (Radford et al., 2019), corresponding to few or no labelled data in the prompt, respectively. Recent studies have shown the strategy of few-shot inference (Brown et al., 2020; Logan IV et al., 2021; Zhu et al., 2023; Garg et al., 2022) that provides few labelled data in the prompt can help improve the LLM's comprehension of the required task and thus improving the performance in downstream classification tasks. Our proposed prompt-based adversarial attack aims to ask the LLM to implement adversarial attacks against itself and thus helps to effectively evaluate the LLM's robustness, instead of solving classification tasks.

Prompt engineering. Prompt engineering (Liu et al., 2023b), a.k.a. prompt template engineering, refers to the act of developing the most suitable prompt template for the downstream task that leads to state-of-the-art performance. Recent research works have focused on studying how to automatically generate a prompt (Shin et al., 2020) and how to enhance the power of the prompt (Gao et al., 2020) so that it improves the LLM's performance in downstream tasks. In our paper, we design a template of an attack prompt that aims to ask the LLM to generate adversarial samples to fool itself. Our designed prompt template is used for effectively evaluating the LLM's adversarial robustness, instead of enhancing performance in downstream tasks.

## B Extensive Experimental Results

## B.1 GLUE Dataset

In this subsection, we provide a detailed description of the tasks in the GLUE dataset.

- SST-2. The Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2) task (Socher et al., 2013) originates from reviews and is a binary sentiment classification dataset, where the task is to determine whether a given sentence conveys a positive or negative sentiment. Therefore, the SST-2 task has only one sentence type, i.e., 'sentence', and its label set is { 'positive', 'negative' } .
- QQP. The Quora Question Pairs (QQP) task (Wang et al., 2017) is sourced from Quora and serves as a binary classification task, challenging models to identify semantic equivalence between two questions. Thus, the type of sentences in the QQP task belongs to { 'question1', 'question2' } and its label set is { 'duplicate', 'not duplicate' } . In our experiments, we apply PromptAttack to only perturb the sentence of the type 'question1' in the QQP task.
- MNLI. The Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference Corpus (MNLI) task (Williams et al., 2018) compiles data from various sources and is designed for natural language inference, asking models to judge whether a given hypothesis logically follows from a provided premise. There are two versions of the MNLI task: (1) MNLI-m is the matched version of MNLI and (2) MNLI-mm is the mismatched version of MNLI. In the MNLI task, the type of sentences belongs to { 'premise', 'hypothesis' } and the label set of the MNLI task is { 'entailment', 'neutral', 'contradiction' } . In our paper, we apply PromptAttack to only perturb the sentence of the type 'premise' in the MNLI task.
- RTE. The Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) dataset (Dagan et al., 2005; Bar-Haim et al., 2006; Giampiccolo et al., 2007; Bos &amp; Markert, 2005; Bentivogli et al., 2009) comprises text from news articles and presents a binary classification task where models must determine the relationship between two sentences. Therefore, in the RTE dataset, the set of the types of sentences is { 'sentence1', 'sentence2' } and the label set is { 'entailment', 'not entailment' } . In our paper, we apply PromptAttack to only perturb the sentence of the type 'sentence1' in the RTE task.
- QNLI. The Question-answering Natural Language Inference (QNLI) dataset (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) primarily focuses on natural language inference. Models are required to decide whether an answer to a given question can be found within a provided sentence. In the QNLI task, the type of sentence is sampled from { 'question', 'sentence' } and the label set is { 'entailment', 'not entailment' } . In our paper, we apply PromptAttack to only perturb the sentence of the type 'question' in the QNLI task.

## B.2 BERTScore

Formulation of BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2019). Given an original sentence x and its adversarial variant ˜ x , we let l ∈ N and ˜ l ∈ N denote the number of words of the sentences x and ˜ x , respectively. BERTScore h bert ( x, ˜ x ) ∈ [0 , 1]

is calculated as follows:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where v and ˜ v are the embeddings of the sentence x and ˜ x extracted from a pre-trained RoBERTa-large model, respectively. Note that v and ˜ v are normalized to [0 , 1] . Therefore, the range of the value of h ( x, ˜ x ) is [0 , 1] . As for the implementation of BERTScore, we exactly follow the official GitHub link of Zhang et al. (2019).

BERTScore threshold τ 2 . Table 8 reports the BERTScore threshold τ 2 which is calculated as the average BERTScore of the adversarial samples in AdvGLUE (Wang et al., 2021) for each task. Note that, the BERTScore threshold τ 2 is used for the fidelity filter to filter out the adversarial sample whose semantic meaning is significantly changed.

ASR w.r.t. BERTScore threshold τ 2 . Figure 4 demonstrates the ASR w.r.t. BERTScore threshold τ 2 evaluated in the MNLI-m, QQP, and RTE tasks using GPT-3.5. It shows that our proposed PromptAttack can obtain a higher ASR with a high BERTScore threshold τ 2 in various tasks, which validates the effectiveness of our proposed PromptAttack in generating powerful adversarial samples of high fidelity.

Besides, we find that, in the RTE task, the ASR of AdvGLUE++ becomes higher than that of PromptAttack when τ 2 ≤ 0 . 85 . We argue that the ASR achieved by adversarial samples of low fidelity cannot validate that AdvGLUE++ is a better tool to evaluate robustness than PromptAttack. It is because when BERTScore is low, the semantic meaning of the adversarial samples has been significantly changed. We show several examples of adversarial samples whose BERTScore is lower than 0 . 85 sampled from AdvGLUE++ in Table 18. Observed from Table 18, the semantic meaning of adversarial samples is significantly changed, which makes it meaningless to consider the ASR of such adversarial samples of low fidelity. Therefore, we only consider the ASR at a high BRTScore threshold and our proposed PromptAttack is the most effective attack to generate effective adversarial samples of a high BERTScore.

## B.3 ASR without Fidelity Filter

Table 9 reports the ASR under AdvGLUE++ (Wang et al., 2023a) and our proposed PromoptAttack without the fidelity filter. It validates that, without a fidelity filter, our proposed PromptAttack can still yield a higher ASR compared to AdvGLUE++ (Wang et al., 2023a).

However, we argue that the ASR without the fidelity filter is meaningless. As shown in Table 18, the semantic meanings of adversarial samples whose BERTScore is lower than 0.85 in the AdvGLUE++ dataset are significantly changed. Note that, the adversarial sample should maintain its original semantic meanings (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2021). Therefore, it is meaningless to analyze the attack power of the method according to the ASR without the fidelity filter.

## B.4 Standard Deviation of the ASR Reported in Table 3

Table 10 demonstrates the standard deviation of the ASR reported in Table 3. We find that the standard deviation of the ASR evaluated using Llama2 is extremely high in some tasks such as MNLI-mm and QNLI. The reason is that the ASR evaluated via zero-shot task descriptions and the ASR evaluated via few-shot task descriptions are extremely divergent achieved by Llama2 in MNLI-mm and QNLI tasks (as shown in Table 5 and 15), which makes the standard deviation of the ASR evaluated using Llama2 is significantly high.

## B.5 ASR Evaluated via Different Types of Task Descriptions

Tables 11-15 demonstrate the ASR evaluated via different types of task descriptions in various tasks. The results show that the ASR via zero-shot (ZS) task descriptions is lower than few-shot (FS) task descriptions using GPT-3.5 in most tasks, which is in line with the conclusion of Zhu et al. (2023). However, an interesting phenomenon is that the ASR via ZS task descriptions is always lower than FS task descriptions using Llama2. We guess that it is because the ability of small-scale LLM Llama2 to understand the few-shot examples is worse than that of large-scale LLM GPT-3.5. The extra examples provided in the FS task descriptions can confuse Llama2 on how to solve the task, thus degrading the performance of Llama2 when using FS inference (Logan IV et al., 2021).

Moreover, in Table 16, we demonstrate the ASR of adversarial samples generated by PromptAttack against Llama2-7B and GPT-3.5 evaluated using BERT-based models. We used pre-trained BERT encoders with the version 'bert-baseuncased' and pre-trained RoBERTa encoders with the version 'roberta-base'. For each task, the standard model is obtained by standardly fine-tuning a composition of a pre-trained encoder and a classifier in the training dataset of the task; the robust model is obtained by adversarially fine-tuning a composition of a pre-trained encoder and a classifier in the training dataset of the task. We used the [official code](https://github.com/zhuchen03/FreeLB) of FreeLB (Zhu et al., 2019) to implement the fine-tuning of BERT-based models.

Note that, we also leveraged the ensemble strategy during the robustness evaluation of attack transferability. To be specific, for each data point ( x, y ) ∈ D , PromptAttack according to different perturbation instructions against the victim LLM can generate nine adversarial variants { ˜ x (1) , . . . , ˜ x (9) } . Then, while transferring them to attack another victim language model, we traversed all the adversarial variants from ˜ x (1) to ˜ x (9) , and took the sample that can successfully fool the victim language model and has the highest BERTScore for calculating the ASR achieved by the victim language model; otherwise, we took the original sample for calculating the ASR.

Extensive analyses. We observe that BERT-based models are also vulnerable to transferable PromptAttack. In particular, the results validate that adversarial training (Zhu et al., 2019; Madry et al., 2018) is effective in enhancing the adversarial robustness since the robust BERT-based models always yield a lower ASR than standard BERT-based models. It inspires us to utilize the adversarial training to adversarially fine-tune LLMs so that defend LLMs against adversarial attacks in downstream tasks.

Besides, we find that the ASR achieved by BERT-based models (shown in Table 16) is lower than that achieved by LLMs such as GPT-3.5 (shown in Table 3), which seems to show that BERT-based models gain better robustness against adversarial samples. The main reason could be that BERT-based models are fine-tuned on the training set of each downstream task, which substantially improves their generalization ability and adversarial robustness in the downstream task; whereas, LLMs perform the task based on the prompt without being fine-tuned, which degrades their performance in downstream tasks despite having a large number of parameters.

## B.7 Extensive Examples

Extra examples generated by PromptAttack against GPT-3.5 in the SST-2 task. We provide extensive examples of the adversarial samples generated by PromptAttack against GPT-3.5 in the SST-2 task in Table 17. Our results can be reproduced by setting the version of GPT-3.5 as 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0301' and the temperature as 0 . 0 , and using the task description 'Evaluate the sentiment of the given text and classify it as 'positive' or 'negative': Sentence: &lt; sample &gt; Answer:'.

Adversarial samples of low BERTScore. Table 18 demonstrates five adversarial examples whose BERTScore is lower than 0.85 sampled from the RTE task in the AdvGLUE++ dataset. We can find that the semantic meanings of the adversarial sample and its original version are significantly different when BERTScore is low.

Adversarial samples generated by PromptAttack-FS-EN using Llama2-7B. Wedemonstrate adversarial samples generated by PromptAttack-FS-EN using Llama2-7B in Table 19. We observe that the generated content by Llama27B under PromptAttack-FS-EN always contains two sentences connected by a meaningless arrow pattern ('-&gt; '), which exactly follows the format of extra examples in the few-shot AG. It indicates that the few-shot strategy can significantly degrade the quality of adversarial samples generated by Llama2 which has a poor comprehension ability. As a result, the generated adversarial samples are easily recognized as low fidelity and filtered out by the fidelity filter, thus leading to a low ASR achieved by PromptAttack-FS-EN against Llama2.

Table 17: Extensive examples of the adversarial samples generated by PromptAttack against GPT-3.5 in the SST-2 task (Socher et al., 2013). The results can be reproduced by setting the version of GPT-3.5 as 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0301' and the temperature as 0 . 0 , and using the task description 'Evaluate the sentiment of the given text and classify it as 'positive' or 'negative': Sentence: &lt; sample &gt; Answer:'.

Table 18: We demonstrate five adversarial samples whose BERTScore is lower than 0.85 and their original variants sampled from the RTE task in the AdvGLUE++ dataset. We can find that, when BERTScore is low, the semantic meaning of the adversarial sample and its original version are significantly different.
